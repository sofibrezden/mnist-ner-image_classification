The bald eagle Haliaeetus leucocephalus is a bird of prey found in North America,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A sea eagle it has two known subspecies and forms a species pair with the whitetailed eagle Haliaeetus albicilla which occupies the same niche as the bald eagle in the Palearctic,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska all of the contiguous United States and northern Mexico,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and oldgrowth trees for nesting,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on fish which it swoops down upon and snatches from the water with its talons,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It builds the largest nest of any North American bird and the largest tree nests ever recorded for any animal species up to 4 m 13 ft deep 25 m 82 ft wide and 1 metric ton 11 short tons in weight,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sexual maturity is attained at the age of four to five years,O O O O O O O O O O O O
Bald eagles are not bald the name derives from an older meaning of the word whiteheaded,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The plumage of the immature is brown,O O O O O O O
The bald eagle is the national symbol of the United States and appears on its seal,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the late 20th century it was on the brink of extirpation in the contiguous United States but measures such as banning the practice of hunting bald eagles and banning the use of the harmful pesticide DDT slowed the decline of their population,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Populations have since recovered and the species status was upgraded from endangered to threatened in 1995 and removed from the list altogether in 2007,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In 2024 the bald eagle was officially made the national bird of the United States,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The bald eagle is placed in the genus Haliaeetus sea eagles and gets both its common and specific scientific names from the distinctive appearance of the adults head,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Bald in the English name is from an older usage meaning having white on the face or head rather than hairless referring to the white head feathers contrasting with the darker body,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The bald eagle was one of the many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his 18thcentury work Systema Naturae under the name Falco leucocephalus,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The bald eagle forms a species pair with the whitetailed eagle of Eurasia,O O O O O O O O O O O O O

This form is conventionally said to be related to a ProtoIndoEuropean word for brown so that bear would mean the brown one,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O
However Ringe notes that while this etymology is semantically plausible a word meaning brown of this form cannot be found in ProtoIndoEuropean,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The male usually ejaculates three or four times within a single mating session,O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Camelids are the only ungulates to mate in a sitting position,O O O O O O O O O O O
Camels do not directly store water in their humps they are reservoirs of fatty tissue,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When this tissue is metabolized it yields a greater mass of water than that of the fat processed,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This fat metabolization while releasing energy causes water to evaporate from the lungs during respiration as oxygen is required for the metabolic process overall there is a net decrease in water,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Camels have a series of physiological adaptations that allow them to withstand long periods of time without any external source of water,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The dromedary camel can drink as seldom as once every 10 days even under very hot conditions and can lose up to 30 of its body mass due to dehydration,O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Unlike other mammals camels red blood cells are oval rather than circular in shape,O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O
This facilitates the flow of red blood cells during dehydration and makes them better at withstanding high osmotic variation without rupturing when drinking large amounts of water,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Camels are able to withstand changes in body temperature and water consumption that would kill most other mammals,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Their temperature ranges from 34 C 93 F at dawn and steadily increases to 40 C 104 F by sunset before they cool off at night again,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In general to compare between camels and the other livestock camels lose only 13 liters of fluid intake every day while the other livestock lose 20 to 40 liters per day,O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Maintaining the brain temperature within certain limits is critical for animals to assist this camels have a rete mirabile a complex of arteries and veins lying very close to each other which utilizes countercurrent blood flow to cool blood flowing to the brain,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Camels rarely sweat even when ambient temperatures reach 49 C 120 F,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O
Any sweat that does occur evaporates at the skin level rather than at the surface of their coat the heat of vaporization therefore comes from body heat rather than ambient heat,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Camels can withstand losing 25 of their body weight in water whereas most other mammals can withstand only about 1214 dehydration before cardiac failure results from circulatory disturbance,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The taxonomy of fossil hydrochoerines is also in a state of flux,O O O O O O O O O O O O
In recent years the diversity of fossil hydrochoerines has been substantially reduced,O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is largely due to the recognition that capybara molar teeth show strong variation in shape over the life of an individual,O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O

This is because female crabs brood fertilised eggs on their pleopods,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O
Crabs attract a mate through chemical pheromones visual acoustic or vibratory means,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O
Pheromones are used by most fully aquatic crabs while terrestrial and semiterrestrial crabs often use visual signals such as fiddler crab males waving their large claws to attract females,O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O
The vast number of brachyuran crabs have internal fertilisation and mate bellytobelly,O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O
For many aquatic species mating takes place just after the female has moulted and is still soft,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Females can store the sperm for a long time before using it to fertilise their eggs,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When fertilisation has taken place the eggs are released onto the females abdomen below the tail flap secured with a sticky material,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this location they are protected during embryonic development,O O O O O O O O O
Females carrying eggs are called berried since the eggs resemble round berries,O O O O O O O O O O O O
When development is complete the female releases the newly hatched larvae into the water where they are part of the plankton,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The release is often timed with the tidal and lightdark diurnal cycle,O O O O O O O O O O O O
The freeswimming tiny zoea larvae can float and take advantage of water currents,O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They have a spine which probably reduces the rate of predation by larger animals,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The zoea of most species must find food but some crabs provide enough yolk in the eggs that the larval stages can continue to live off the yolk,O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Crocodiles family Crocodylidae or true crocodiles are large semiaquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa Asia the Americas and Australia,ANIMAL O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The term crocodile is sometimes used more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia which includes the alligators and caimans both members of the family Alligatoridae the gharial and false gharial both members of the family Gavialidae as well as other extinct taxa,O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although crocodiles alligators and the gharial are similar in appearance they belong to separate biological families,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The gharial with its narrow snout is easier to distinguish while morphological differences are more difficult to spot in crocodiles and alligators,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O
The most obvious external differences are visible in the head with crocodiles having narrower and longer heads with a more Vshaped than a Ushaped snout compared to alligators and caimans,O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Another obvious trait is that the upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width and the teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed therefore all teeth are visible unlike an alligator which possesses in the upper jaw small depressions into which the lower teeth fit,O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also when the crocodiles mouth is closed the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction in the upper jaw,O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For hardtodistinguish specimens the protruding tooth is the most reliable feature to define the species family,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Crocodiles have more webbing on the toes of the hind feet and can better tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt glands for filtering out salt which are present but nonfunctioning in alligators,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Another trait that separates crocodiles from other crocodilians is their much higher levels of aggression,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O
Crocodile size morphology behaviour and ecology differ somewhat among species,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O
However they have many similarities in these areas as well,O O O O O O O O O O
All crocodiles are semiaquatic and tend to congregate in freshwater habitats such as rivers lakes wetlands and sometimes in brackish water and saltwater,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are carnivorous animals feeding mostly on vertebrates such as fish reptiles birds and mammals and sometimes on invertebrates such as molluscs and crustaceans depending on species and age,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All crocodiles are tropical species that unlike alligators are very sensitive to cold,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O
They separated from other crocodilians during the Eocene epoch about 55 million years ago,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Many species are at the risk of extinction some being classified as critically endangered,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The word crocodile comes from Ancient Greek κροκόδιλος krokódilos lizard used in the phrase ho krokódilos tou potamoú the lizard of the Nile river,O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There are several variant Greek forms of the word attested including the later form krokódeilos κροκόδειλος found cited in many English reference works,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the Koine Greek of Roman times krokodilos and krokodeilos would have been pronounced identically and either or both may be the source of the Latinized form crocodīlus used by the ancient Romans,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It has been suggested but it is not certain that the word crocodilos or crocodeilos is a compound of krokè pebbles and drilosdreilos worm although drilos is only attested as a colloquial term for penis,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is ascribed to Herodotus and supposedly describes the basking habits of the Egyptian crocodile,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL
The form crocodrillus is attested in Medieval Latin,O O O O O O O O
It is not clear whether this is a medieval corruption or derives from alternative GrecoLatin forms late Greek corcodrillos and corcodrillion are attested,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A further corrupted form cocodrille is found in Old French and was borrowed into Middle English as cocodrille,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Modern English form crocodile was adapted directly from the Classical Latin crocodīlus in the 16th century replacing the earlier form,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The use of y in the scientific name Crocodylus and forms derived from it is a corruption introduced by Laurenti 1768,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Most Anisoptera species are tropical with far fewer species in temperate regions,O O O O O O O O O O O O
Dragonflies become scarce at higher latitudes,ANIMAL O O O O O
They are not native to Iceland but individuals are occasionally swept in by strong winds including a Hemianax ephippiger native to North Africa and an unidentified darter species,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In Kamchatka only a few species of dragonfly including the treeline emerald Somatochlora arctica and some aeshnids such as Aeshna subarctica are found possibly because of the low temperature of the lakes there,O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The treeline emerald also lives in northern Alaska within the Arctic Circle making it the most northerly of all dragonflies,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL
An adult dragonfly has three distinct segments the head thorax and abdomen as in all insects,O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It has a chitinous exoskeleton of hard plates held together with flexible membranes,O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The head is large with very short antennae,O O O O O O O O
It is dominated by the two compound eyes which cover most of its surface,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The compound eyes are made up of ommatidia the numbers being greater in the larger species,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Aeshna interrupta has 22650 ommatidia of two varying sizes 4500 being large,O O O O O O O O O O O O
The facets facing downward tend to be smaller,O O O O O O O O
Petalura gigantea has 23890 ommatidia of just one size,O O O O O O O O O
These facets provide complete vision in the frontal hemisphere of the dragonfly,O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL
The compound eyes meet at the top of the head except in the Petaluridae and Gomphidae as also in the genus Epiophlebia,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also they have three simple eyes or ocelli,O O O O O O O O
The mouthparts are adapted for biting with a toothed jaw the flaplike labrum at the front of the mouth can be shot rapidly forward to catch prey,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The head has a system for locking it in place that consists of muscles and small hairs on the back of the head that grip structures on the front of the first thoracic segment,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This arrester system is unique to the Odonata and is activated when feeding and during tandem flight,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Dragonfly nymphs vary in form with species and are loosely classed into claspers sprawlers hiders and burrowers,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The first instar is known as a prolarva a relatively inactive stage from which it quickly moults into the more active nymphal form,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The general body plan is similar to that of an adult but the nymph lacks wings and reproductive organs,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The lower jaw has a huge extensible labium armed with hooks and spines which is used for catching prey,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This labium is folded under the body at rest and struck out at great speed by hydraulic pressure created by the abdominal muscles,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Both damselfly and dragonfly nymphs ventilate the rectum but just some damselfly nymphs have a rectal epithelium that is rich in trachea relying mostly on three feathery external gills as their major source of respiration,O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Only dragonfly nymphs have internal gills called a branchial chamber located around the fourth and fifth abdominal segments,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These internal gills consist originally of six longitudinal folds each side supported by crossfolds,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But this system has been modified in several families,O O O O O O O O O
Water is pumped in and out of the abdomen through an opening at the tip,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The naiads of some clubtails Gomphidae that burrow into the sediment have a snorkellike tube at the end of the abdomen enabling them to draw in clean water while they are buried in mud,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Naiads can forcefully expel a jet of water to propel themselves with great rapidity,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Duck is the common name for numerous species of waterfowl in the family Anatidae,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ducks are generally smaller and shorternecked than swans and geese which are members of the same family,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Divided among several subfamilies they are a form taxon they do not represent a monophyletic group the group of all descendants of a single common ancestral species since swans and geese are not considered ducks,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL
Ducks are mostly aquatic birds and may be found in both fresh water and sea water,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ducks are sometimes confused with several types of unrelated water birds with similar forms such as loons or divers grebes gallinules and coots,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The word duck comes from Old English dūce diver a derivative of the verb dūcan to duck bend down low as if to get under something or dive because of the way many species in the dabbling duck group feed by upending compare with Dutch duiken and German tauchen to dive,O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Eagle is the common name for the golden eagle bald eagle and other birds of prey in the family of the Accipitridae,ANIMAL O O O O O O O ANIMAL O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O
Eagles belong to several groups of genera some of which are closely related,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
True eagles comprise the genus Aquila,O ANIMAL O O O O
Most of the 68 species of eagles are from Eurasia and Africa,O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O
Outside this area just 14 species can be foundtwo in North America nine in Central and South America and three in Australia,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Eagles are not a natural group but denote essentially any kind of bird of prey large enough to hunt sizeable about 50 cm long or more overall vertebrates,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The word eagle is borrowed into English from AngloNorman eagle and Middle French aigle both derived ultimately from Latin aquila eagle,O O ANIMAL O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL
It is cognate with terms such as French aigle Portuguese águia and Spanish águila,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is broadly synonymous with the less common English term erne or earn deriving from Middle English ern from Old English earn in which it acts as the usual word for the bird,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Old English term is turn derived from ProtoGermanic arnaz and is cognate with other synonymous words in Germanic languages such as Swedish örn German Aar and Gothic ara,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Through the ProtoIndoEuropean root it is further related to words such as ὄρνις bird and Lithuanian erelis eagle,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL
Although erne can be used to refer to any eagle it is most commonly used for the golden eagle or seaeagle,O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O
Eagles are large powerfullybuilt birds of prey with heavy heads and beaks,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O

Like all birds of prey eagles have very large hooked beaks for ripping flesh from their prey strong muscular legs and powerful talons,O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The beak is typically heavier than that of most other birds of prey,O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Eagles eyes are extremely powerful,ANIMAL O O O O
It is estimated that the wedgetailed eagle has a visual acuity twice that of a typical human,O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O
This acuity enables eagles to spot potential prey from a very long distance,O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O
This keen eyesight is primarily attributed to their extremely large pupils which ensure minimal diffraction scattering of the incoming light,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Like most diurnal raptors eagles have little ability to see ultraviolet light,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O
The female of all known species of eagles is larger than the male,O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O
Eagles normally build their nests called eyries in tall trees or on high cliffs,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Many species lay two eggs but the older larger chick frequently kills its younger sibling once it has hatched,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Echidnas  sometimes known as spiny anteaters are quillcovered monotremes egglaying mammals belonging to the family Tachyglossidae  living in Australia and New Guinea,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The four extant species of echidnas and the platypus are the only living mammals that lay eggs and the only surviving members of the order Monotremata,O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The diet of some species consists of ants and termites but they are not closely related to the American true anteaters or to hedgehogs,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Their young are called puggles,O O O O O
Echidnas evolved between 20 and 50 million years ago descending from a platypuslike monotreme,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This ancestor was aquatic but echidnas adapted to life on land,O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O
Echidnas are possibly named after Echidna a creature from Greek mythology who was halfwoman halfsnake as the animal was perceived to have qualities of both mammals and reptiles,ANIMAL O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Echidnas are mediumsized solitary mammals covered with coarse hair and spines,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O
The spines are modified hairs and are made of keratin the same fibrous protein that makes up fur claws nails and horn sheaths in animals,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Superficially they resemble the anteaters of South America and other spiny mammals such as hedgehogs and porcupines,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are usually black or brown in coloration,O O O O O O O O
There have been several reports of albino echidnas with pink eyes and white spines,O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O

This is similar to the platypus which has 40000 electroreceptors on its bill but the longbeaked echidna has only 2000 while the shortbeaked echidna which lives in a drier environment has no more than 400 at the tip of its snout,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Echidnas have short strong limbs with large claws and are powerful diggers,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O
Their hind claws are elongated and curved backwards to aid in digging,O O O O O O O O O O O O
Echidnas have tiny mouths and toothless jaws and feed by tearing open soft logs anthills and the like and licking off prey with their long sticky tongues,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The ears are slits on the sides of their heads under the spines,O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The external ear is created by a large cartilaginous funnel deep in the muscle,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At 33 C 914 F echidnas also possess the secondlowest active body temperature of all mammals behind the platypus,O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The emu is an important cultural icon of Australia appearing on the coat of arms and various coinages,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The bird features prominently in Indigenous Australian mythologies,O O O O O O O O
The etymology of the common name emu is uncertain but is thought to have come from an Arabic word for large bird that was later used by Portuguese explorers to describe the related cassowary in Australia and New Guinea,O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Another theory is that it comes from the word ema which is used in Portuguese to denote a large bird akin to an ostrich or crane,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In Victoria some terms for the emu were Barrimal in the Dja Dja Wurrung language myoure in Gunai and courn in Jardwadjali,O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The birds were known as murawung or birabayin to the local Eora and Darug inhabitants of the Sydney basin,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Emus were first reported as having been seen by Europeans when explorers visited the western coast of Australia in 1696,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This was during an expedition led by Dutch captain Willem de Vlamingh who was searching for survivors of a ship that had gone missing two years earlier,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The birds were known on the eastern coast before 1788 when the first Europeans settled there,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The birds were first mentioned under the name of the New Holland cassowary in Arthur Phillips Voyage to Botany Bay published in 1789 with the following description The species was named by ornithologist John Latham in 1790 based on a specimen from the Sydney area of Australia a country which was known as New Holland at the time,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He collaborated on Phillips book and provided the first descriptions of and names for many Australian bird species Dromaius comes from a Greek word meaning racer and novaehollandiae is the Latin term for New Holland so the name can be rendered as fastfooted New Hollander,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In his original 1816 description of the emu the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot used two generic names first Dromiceius and later Dromaius,O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It has been a point of contention ever since as to which name should be used the latter is more correctly formed but the convention in taxonomy is that the first name given to an organism stands unless it is clearly a typographical error,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Most modern publications including those of the Australian government use Dromaius with Dromiceius mentioned as an alternative spelling,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Falcons  are birds of prey in the genus Falco which includes about 40 species,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some small species of falcons with long narrow wings are called hobbies and some that hover while hunting are called kestrels,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Falcons are widely distributed on all continents of the world except Antarctica though closely related raptors did occur there in the Eocene,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Adult falcons have thin tapered wings which enable them to fly at high speed and change direction rapidly,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Fledgling falcons in their first year of flying have longer flight feathers which make their configuration more like that of a generalpurpose bird such as a broadwing,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This makes flying easier while still learning the aerial skills required to be effective hunters like the adults,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The falcons are the largest genus in the Falconinae subfamily of Falconidae which also includes two other subfamilies comprising caracaras and a few other species of falcons,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL
All these birds kill prey with their beaks using a tomial tooth on the side of their beaksunlike the hawks eagles and other larger birds of prey from the unrelated family Accipitridae who use talons on their feet,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The largest falcon is the gyrfalcon at up to 65 cm 26 in in length,O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
The smallest falcon species is the pygmy falcon which measures just 20 cm 79 in,O O ANIMAL O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O
As with hawks and owls falcons exhibit sexual dimorphism with the females typically larger than the males thus allowing a wider range of prey species,O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The genus name Falco is Late Latin meaning a falcon from falx falcis meaning a sickle referring to the claws of the bird,O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In Middle English and Old French the title faucon refers generically to several captive raptor species,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The traditional term for a male falcon is tercel British spelling or tiercel American spelling from the Latin tertius third because of the belief that only one in three eggs hatched a male bird,O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some sources give the etymology as deriving from the fact that a male falcon is about onethird smaller than a female Old French tiercelet,O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O
A falcon chick especially one reared for falconry still in its downy stage is known as an eyas sometimes spelled eyass,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Hyenas or hyaenas  hiEEnəz from Ancient Greek ὕαινα hýaina are feliform carnivoran mammals belonging to the family Hyaenidae ,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
With just four extant species each in its own genus it is the fifthsmallest family in the order Carnivora and one of the smallest in the class Mammalia,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Despite their low diversity hyenas are unique and vital components of most African ecosystems,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O
Although phylogenetically closer to felines and viverrids hyenas are behaviourally and morphologically similar to canids in several elements due to convergent evolution both hyenas and canines are nonarboreal cursorial hunters that catch prey with their teeth rather than claws,O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Hyenas originated in the jungles of Miocene Eurasia 22 million years ago when most early feliform species were still largely arboreal,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The first ancestral hyenas were likely similar to the modern African civet one of the earliest hyena species described Plioviverrops was a lithe civetlike animal that inhabited Eurasia 2022 million years ago and is identifiable as a hyaenid by the structure of the middle ear and dentition,O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The lineage of Plioviverrops prospered and gave rise to descendants with longer legs and more pointed jaws a direction similar to that taken by canids in North America,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hyenas then diversified into two distinct types lightly built doglike hyenas and robust bonecrushing hyenas,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O ANIMAL
Although the doglike hyenas thrived 15 million years ago with one taxon having colonised North America they became extinct after a change in climate along with the arrival of canids into Eurasia,O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The decline of the doglike hyenas began 57 million years ago during a period of climate change exacerbated by canids crossing the Bering land bridge to Eurasia,O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One species Chasmaporthetes ossifragus managed to cross the land bridge into North America being the only hyena to do so,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O
Chasmaporthetes managed to survive for some time in North America by deviating from the endurancerunning and bonecrushing niches monopolized by canids and developing into a cheetahlike sprinter,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

While they do not form a monophyletic clade all jackals are opportunistic omnivores predators of small to mediumsized animals and proficient scavengers,O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
Their long legs and curved canine teeth are adapted for hunting small mammals birds and reptiles and their large feet and fused leg bones give them a physique wellsuited for longdistance running capable of maintaining speeds of 16 kmh 10 mph for extended periods of time,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jackals are crepuscular most active at dawn and dusk,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O
Their most common social unit is a monogamous pair which defends its territory from other pairs by vigorously chasing intruders and marking landmarks around the territory with their urine and feces,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The territory may be large enough to hold some young adults which stay with their parents until they establish their own territories,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jackals may occasionally assemble in small packs for example to scavenge a carcass but they normally hunt either alone or in pairs,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Similarities between jackals and coyotes led Lorenz Oken in the third volume of his Lehrbuch der Naturgeschichte 1815 to place these species into a new separate genus Thos named after the classical Greek word θώς jackal but his theory had little immediate impact on taxonomy at the time,O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
Angel Cabrera in his 1932 monograph on the mammals of Morocco questioned whether or not the presence of a cingulum on the upper molars of the jackals and its corresponding absence in the rest of Canis could justify a subdivision of that genus,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In practice Cabrera chose the undividedgenus alternative and referred to the jackals as Canis instead of Thos,O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O

Like most marsupials female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete postnatal development,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
Because of its grazing habits the kangaroo has developed specialized teeth that are rare among mammals,O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O
Its incisors are able to crop grass close to the ground and its molars chop and grind the grass,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Since the two sides of the lower jaw are not joined or fused together the lower incisors are farther apart giving the kangaroo a wider bite,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O
The silica in grass is abrasive so kangaroo molars are ground down and they actually move forward in the mouth before they eventually fall out and are replaced by new teeth that grow in the back,O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

It is easily recognisable by its stout tailless body and large head with round fluffy ears and large dark nose,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The koala has a body length of 6085 cm 2433 in and weighs 415 kg 88331 lb,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Its fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown,O O O O O O O O O O
Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These populations are possibly separate subspecies but not all researchers accept this,O O O O O O O O O O O O
Koalas typically inhabit open Eucalyptus woodland as the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This eucalypt diet has low nutritional and caloric content and contains toxic compounds that deter most other mammals from feeding on them,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to twenty hours a day,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O
They are asocial only mothers bond to dependent offspring,O O O O O O O O O
Adult males communicate with bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates,O O O O O O O O O O O
Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests,O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Like other marsupials koalas give birth to young known as joeys at a very early stage of development,O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They crawl into their mothers pouches where they live for their first six to seven months,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are fully weaned around a year old,O O O O O O O O
Koalas have few natural predators and parasites but are threatened by pathogens such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and koala retrovirus,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O
Because of their distinctive appearance koalas along with kangaroos are recognised worldwide as symbols of Australia,O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O
They were hunted by Indigenous Australians and depicted in myths and cave art for millennia,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The first recorded encounter between a European and a koala was in 1798 and an image of the animal was published in 1810 by naturalist George Perry,O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Botanist Robert Brown wrote the first detailed scientific description in 1814 although his work remained unpublished for 180 years,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Artist John Gould illustrated and described the koala thereby introducing the species to the British public,O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O
Further details about the animals biology were revealed in the 19th century by English scientists,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Koalas are listed as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Among the many threats to their existence are habitat destruction caused by agriculture urbanisation droughts and associated bushfires some related to climate change,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In February 2022 the koala was officially listed as endangered in the Australian Capital Territory New South Wales and Queensland,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The word koala comes from the Dharug gula meaning no water,O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O
Although the vowel u was originally written in the English orthography as oo in spellings such as coola or koolah  two syllables the spelling later became oa and the word is now pronounced in three syllables possibly in error,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Another hypothesis is that koala was an aboriginal name from the Hawkesbury River district near Sydney,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O
Adopted by white settlers the word koala became one of hundreds of Aboriginal loan words in Australian English where it was also commonly referred to as native bear later koala bear for its resemblance to a bear,O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O
It is one of several Aboriginal words that made it into International English alongside words like didgeridoo and kangaroo,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The generic name Phascolarctos is derived from the Greek words φάσκωλος phaskolos pouch and ἄρκτος arktos bear,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The specific name cinereus is Latin for ash coloured,O O O O O O O O O
The koala was given its generic name Phascolarctos in 1816 by French zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville who did not give it a specific name until further review,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In 1819 German zoologist Georg August Goldfuss gave it the binomial Lipurus cinereus,O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Because Phascolarctos was published first according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature it has priority as the official genus name 5859 French naturalist Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest coined the name Phascolarctos fuscus in 1820 suggesting that the browncoloured versions were a different species than the grey ones,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

As a result of their size Komodo dragons are apex predators and dominate the ecosystems in which they live,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Komodo dragons hunt and ambush prey including invertebrates birds and mammals,O O O O O O O O O O O
Komodo dragons group behavior in hunting is exceptional in the reptile world,O O O O O O O O O O O O
The diet of Komodo dragons mainly consists of Javan rusa Rusa timorensis though they also eat considerable amounts of carrion,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Komodo dragons also occasionally attack humans,O O O O O O
Mating begins between May and August and the eggs are laid in September as many as 20 eggs are deposited at a time in an abandoned megapode nest or in a selfdug nesting hole,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The eggs are incubated for seven to eight months hatching in April when insects are most plentiful,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Young Komodo dragons are vulnerable and dwell in trees to avoid predators such as cannibalistic adults which young Komodo dragons also try to repel by rolling in feces,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They take 8 to 9 years to mature and are estimated to live up to 30 years,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Komodo dragons were first recorded by Western scientists in 1910,O O O O O O O O O O
Their large size and fearsome reputation make them popular zoo exhibits,O O O O O O O O O O O
In the wild their range has been reduced by human encroachment and is likely to contract further from the effects of climate change hence they are listed as Endangered by the IUCN Red List,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are protected under Indonesian law and Komodo National Park was founded in 1980 to aid protection efforts,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Komodo dragons were first documented by Europeans in 1910 when rumors of a land crocodile reached Lieutenant van Steyn van Hensbroek of the Dutch colonial administration,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Widespread notoriety came after 1912 when Peter Ouwens the director of the Zoological Museum of Bogor Java published a paper on the topic after receiving a photo and a skin from the lieutenant as well as two other specimens from a collector,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The first two live Komodo dragons to arrive in Europe were exhibited in the Reptile House at London Zoo when it opened in 1927,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Joan Beauchamp Procter made some of the earliest observations of these animals in captivity and she demonstrated their behaviour at a scientific meeting of the Zoological Society of London in 1928,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Komodo dragon was the driving factor for an expedition to Komodo Island by W,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Douglas Burden in 1926,O O O O
After returning with 12 preserved specimens and two live ones this expedition provided the inspiration for the 1933 movie King Kong,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

A lemming is a small rodent usually found in or near the Arctic in tundra biomes,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lemmings form the subfamily Arvicolinae also known as Microtinae together with voles and muskrats which form part of the superfamily Muroidea which also includes rats mice hamsters and gerbils,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A longstanding myth holds that they exhibit herd mentality and jump off cliffs committing mass suicide,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lemmings measure around 1318 cm 57 in in length and weigh around 2334 g 0812 oz,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lemmings are quite rounded in shape with brown and black long soft fur,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
They have a very short tail a stubby hairy snout short legs and small ears,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They have a flattened claw on the first digit of their front feet which helps them to dig in the snow,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are herbivorous feeding mostly on mosses and grasses,O O O O O O O O O
They also forage through the snow surface to find berries leaves shoots roots bulbs and lichens,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lemmings choose their preferred dietary vegetation disproportionately to its occurrence in their habitat,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
They digest grasses and sedges less effectively than related voles,O O O O O O O O O O
Lemmings do not hibernate through the harsh northern winter,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O
They remain active finding food by burrowing through the snow,O O O O O O O O O O
These rodents live in large tunnel systems beneath the snow in winter which protect them from predators,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Their burrows have rest areas toilet areas and nesting rooms,O O O O O O O O O O
They make nests out of grasses feathers and muskox wool qiviut,O O O O O O O O O O O
In the spring they move to higher ground where they live on mountain heaths or in forests continuously breeding before returning in autumn to the tundra,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Like many other rodents lemmings have periodic population booms and then disperse in all directions seeking food and shelter their natural habitats cannot provide,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Norway lemming and West Siberian lemming are two of the few vertebrates which reproduce so quickly that their population fluctuations are chaotic rather than following linear growth to a carrying capacity or regular oscillations,O O ANIMAL O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Why lemming populations fluctuate with such great variance roughly every four years before numbers drop to near extinction is not known,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lemming behaviour and appearance are markedly different from those of other rodents which are inconspicuously coloured and try to conceal themselves from their predators,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lemmings by contrast are conspicuously coloured and behave aggressively toward predators and even human observers,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The lemming defence system is thought to be based on aposematism warning display,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O
Fluctuations in the lemming population affect the behaviour of predators and may fuel irruptions of birds of prey such as snowy owls to areas further south,O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For many years the population of lemmings was believed to change with the population cycle but now some evidence suggests their predators populations particularly those of the stoat may be more closely involved in changing the lemming population,O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O
Misconceptions about lemmings go back many centuries,O O ANIMAL O O O O
In 1532 the geographer Jacob Ziegler of Bavaria proposed the theory that the creatures fell out of the sky during stormy weather and then died suddenly when the grass grew in spring,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This description was contradicted by natural historian Ole Worm who accepted that lemmings could fall out of the sky but claimed that they had been brought over by the wind rather than created by spontaneous generation,O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Worm published dissections of a lemming which showed that they are anatomically similar to most other rodents such as voles and hamsters and the work of Carl Linnaeus proved that they had a natural origin,O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Lemurs are generally the most social of the strepsirrhine primates living in groups known as troops,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They communicate more with scents and vocalizations than with visual signals,O O O O O O O O O O O
Lemurs have a relatively low basal metabolic rate and as a result may exhibit dormancy such as hibernation or torpor,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They also have seasonal breeding and female social dominance,O O O O O O O O O

Lemur research during the 18th and 19th centuries focused on taxonomy and specimen collection,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Modern studies of lemur ecology and behavior did not begin in earnest until the 1950s and 1960s,O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Initially hindered by political issues on Madagascar during the mid1970s field studies resumed in the 1980s,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lemurs are important for research because their mix of ancestral characteristics and traits shared with anthropoid primates can yield insights on primate and human evolution,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Most species have been discovered or promoted to full species status since the 1990s however lemur taxonomic classification is controversial and depends on which species concept is used,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
Many lemur species remain endangered due to habitat loss and hunting,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O
Although local traditions such as fady generally help protect lemurs and their forests illegal logging economic privation and political instability conspire to thwart conservation efforts,O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Because of these threats and their declining numbers the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN considers lemurs to be the worlds most endangered mammals noting that as of 2013 up to 90 of all lemur species confront the threat of extinction in the wild within the next 20 to 25 years,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Lizards are mainly carnivorous often being sitandwait predators many smaller species eat insects while the Komodo eats mammals as big as water buffalo,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lizards make use of a variety of antipredator adaptations including venom camouflage reflex bleeding and the ability to sacrifice and regrow their tails,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The adult length of species within the suborder ranges from a few centimeters for chameleons such as Brookesia micra and geckos such as Sphaerodactylus ariasae to nearly 3 m 10 ft in the case of the largest living varanid lizard the Komodo dragon,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O
Most lizards are fairly small animals,O ANIMAL O O O O
Lizards typically have rounded torsos elevated heads on short necks four limbs and long tails although some are legless,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lizards and snakes share a movable quadrate bone distinguishing them from the rhynchocephalians which have more rigid diapsid skulls,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some lizards such as chameleons have prehensile tails assisting them in climbing among vegetation,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
As in other reptiles the skin of lizards is covered in overlapping scales made of keratin,O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O
This provides protection from the environment and reduces water loss through evaporation,O O O O O O O O O O O O
This adaptation enables lizards to thrive in some of the driest deserts on earth,O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O
The skin is tough and leathery and is shed sloughed as the animal grows,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Unlike snakes which shed the skin in a single piece lizards slough their skin in several pieces,O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O
The scales may be modified into spines for display or protection and some species have bone osteoderms underneath the scales,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The dentitions of lizards reflect their wide range of diets including carnivorous insectivorous omnivorous herbivorous nectivorous and molluscivorous,O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Species typically have uniform teeth suited to their diet but several species have variable teeth such as cutting teeth in the front of the jaws and crushing teeth in the rear,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Lynx have a short tail characteristic tufts of black hair on the tips of their ears large padded paws for walking on snow and long whiskers on the face,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Under their neck they have a ruff which has black bars resembling a bow tie although this is often not visible,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Body colour varies from medium brown to goldish to beigewhite and is occasionally marked with dark brown spots especially on the limbs,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The birds called magpies in Australia are however not related to the magpies in the rest of the world,O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O
References dating back to Old English call the bird a pie derived from the Latin pica and cognate to French pie this term has fallen out of use,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The tendency in previous centuries was to give birds common names such as robin redbreast which now is called the robin and jenny wren,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The magpie was originally variously maggie pie and mag pie,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O
The term pica for the human disorder involving a compulsive desire to eat items that are not food is borrowed from the Latin name of the magpie pica for its reputed tendency to feed on miscellaneous things,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O
According to some studies magpies do not form the monophyletic group they are traditionally believed to be tails have elongated or shortened independently in multiple lineages of corvid birds,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Traditionally all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes,O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O
Thus monkeys in that sense constitute an incomplete paraphyletic grouping however in the broader sense based on cladistics apes Hominoidea are also included making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard to their scope,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O

Many extinct metatherians such as Alphadon Peradectes Herpetotherium and Pucadelphys were once considered to be early opossums but it has since been recognized that this was solely on the basis of plesiomorphies they are now considered to belong to older branches of Metatheria that are only distantly related to modern opossums,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL
Opossums probably originated in the Amazonia region of northern South America where they began their initial diversification,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They were minor components of South American mammal faunas until the late Miocene when they began to diversify rapidly,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Before that time the ecological niches presently occupied by opossums were occupied by other groups of metatherians such as paucituberculatans and sparassodonts,O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
Large opossums like Didelphis show a pattern of gradually increasing in size over geologic time as sparassodont diversity declined,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Most birds of prey have eyes on the sides of their heads but the stereoscopic nature of the owls forwardfacing eyes permits the greater sense of depth perception necessary for lowlight hunting,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Owls have binocular vision but they must rotate their entire heads to change the focus of their view because like most birds their eyes are fixed in their sockets,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Owls are farsighted and cannot clearly see anything nearer than a few centimetres of their eyes,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

An ox pl oxen also known as a bullock in British Australian and Indian English is a large bovine trained and used as a draft animal,O ANIMAL O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Oxen are commonly castrated adult male cattle because castration inhibits testosterone and aggression which makes the males docile and safer to work with,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cows adult females or bulls intact males may also be used in some areas,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Oxen are thought to have first been harnessed and put to work around 4000 BC,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Working oxen are taught to respond to the signals of the teamster bullocky or oxdriver,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The signals are given by oral command and body language reinforced by a goad whip or a long pole which also serves as a measure of length see rod,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In preindustrial times teamsters were known for their loud voices and forthright language,O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the New England tradition young castrated cattle selected for draft are known as working steers and are painstakingly trained from a young age,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Their teamster makes or buys as many as a dozen yokes of different sizes for each animal as it grows,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

As a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in the mid20th century raccoons are now also distributed across central Europe the Caucasus and Japan,O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O
In Europe the raccoon has been included on the list of Invasive Alien Species of Union Concern since 2016,O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This implies that this species cannot be imported bred transported commercialized or intentionally released into the environment in the whole of the European Union,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Though previously thought to be generally solitary there is now evidence that raccoons engage in sexspecific social behavior,O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O

In Spanish the raccoon is called mapache derived from the Nahuatl mapachtli of the Aztecs meaning  one who takes everything in its hands,O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The colloquial abbreviation coon is used in words like coonskin for fur clothing and in phrases like old coon as a selfdesignation of trappers,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the 1830s the United States Whig Party used the raccoon as an emblem causing them to be pejoratively known as coons by their political opponents who saw them as too sympathetic to AfricanAmericans,O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The two African species the white rhinoceros and the black rhinoceros belong to the tribe Dicerotini which originated in the middle Miocene about 142 million years ago,O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The species diverged during the early Pliocene about 5 million years ago,O O O O O O O O O O O O
The main difference between black and white rhinos is the shape of their mouths  white rhinos have broad flat lips for grazing whereas black rhinos have long pointed lips for eating foliage,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There are two living Rhinocerotini species the Indian rhinoceros and the Javan rhinoceros which diverged from one another about 10 million years ago,O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O

Salmon are typically anadromous they hatch in the shallow gravel beds of freshwater headstreams and spend their juvenile years in rivers lakes and freshwater wetlands migrate to the ocean as adults and live like sea fish then return to their freshwater birthplace to reproduce,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However populations of several species are restricted to fresh waters ie landlocked throughout their lives,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact stream where they themselves hatched to spawn and tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A portion of a returning salmon run may stray and spawn in different freshwater systems the percent of straying depends on the species of salmon,O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL
Homing behavior has been shown to depend on olfactory memory,O O O O O O O O O O
Salmon are important food fish and are intensively farmed in many parts of the world with Norway being the worlds largest producer of farmed salmon followed by Chile,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O
They are also highly prized game fish for recreational fishing by both freshwater and saltwater anglers,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Many species of salmon have since been introduced and naturalized into nonnative environments such as the Great Lakes of North America Patagonia in South America and South Island of New Zealand,O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Modern English term salmon is derived from Middle English samoun samon and saumon which in turn are from AngloNorman saumon from Old French saumon and from Latin salmō which in turn might have originated from salire meaning to leap,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The unpronounced l absent from Middle English was later added as a Latinisation to make the word closer to its Latin root,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The term salmon has mostly displaced its now dialectal synonym lax in turn from Middle English lax from Old English leax from ProtoGermanic lahsaz from ProtoIndoEuropean lakso,O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The seven commercially important species of salmon occur in two genera of the subfamily Salmoninae,O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O
The genus Salmo contains the Atlantic salmon found in both sides of the North Atlantic as well as more than 40 other species commonly named as trout,O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The genus Oncorhynchus contains 12 recognised species which occur naturally only in the North Pacific six of which are known as Pacific salmon while the remainder are considered trout,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O
Outside their native habitats Chinook salmon have been successfully introduced in New Zealand and Patagonia while coho sockeye and Atlantic salmon have been established in Patagonia as well,O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O
 Both the Salmo and Oncorhynchus genera also contain a number of trout species informally referred to as salmon,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL

Three species the Australian sea lion the Galápagos sea lion and the New Zealand sea lion are listed as endangered,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sea lions are related to walruses and seals,O O O O O O O O
Together with the fur seals they constitute the family Otariidae collectively known as eared seals,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Until recently sea lions were grouped under a single subfamily called Otariinae whereas fur seals were grouped in the subfamily Arcocephalinae,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This division was based on the most prominent common feature shared by the fur seals and absent in the sea lions namely the dense underfur characteristic of the former,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Recent genetic evidence suggests Callorhinus the genus of the northern fur seal is more closely related to some sea lion species than to the other fur seal genus Arctocephalus,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore the fur sealsea lion subfamily distinction has been eliminated from many taxonomies,O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nonetheless all fur seals have certain features in common the fur generally smaller sizes farther and longer foraging trips smaller and more abundant prey items and greater sexual dimorphism,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All sea lions have certain features in common in particular their coarse short fur greater bulk and larger prey than fur seals,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For these reasons the distinction remains useful,O O O O O O O
The family Otariidae Order Carnivora contains the 15 extant species of fur seals and sea lions,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Traditional classification of the family into the subfamilies Arctocephalinae fur seals and Otariinae sea lions is not supported with the fur seal Callorhinus ursinus having a basal relationship relative to the rest of the family,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is consistent with the fossil record which suggests that this genus diverged from the line leading to the remaining fur seals and sea lions about 6 million years ago mya,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Similar genetic divergences between the sea lion clades as well as between the major Arctocephalus fur seal clades suggest that these groups underwent periods of rapid radiation at about the time they diverged from each other,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The phylogenetic relationships within the family and the genetic distances among some taxa highlight inconsistencies in the current taxonomic classification of the family,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Arctocephalus is characterized by ancestral character states such as dense underfur and the presence of double rooted cheek teeth and is thus thought to represent the most primitive line,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was from this basal line that both the sea lions and the remaining fur seal genus Callorhinus are thought to have diverged,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The fossil record from the western coast of North America presents evidence for the divergence of Callorhinus about 6 mya whereas fossils in both California and Japan suggest that sea lions did not diverge until years later,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Anatomically spiders as with all arachnids differ from other arthropods in that the usual body segments are fused into two tagmata the cephalothorax or prosoma and the opisthosoma or abdomen and joined by a small cylindrical pedicel,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However as there is currently neither paleontological nor embryological evidence that spiders ever had a separate thoraxlike division there exists an argument against the validity of the term cephalothorax which means fused cephalon head and the thorax,O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Similarly arguments can be formed against the use of the term abdomen as the opisthosoma of all spiders contains a heart and respiratory organs organs atypical of an abdomen,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O

About 1900 species of starfish live on the seabed in all the worlds oceans from warm tropical zones to frigid polar regions,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are found from the intertidal zone down to abyssal depths at 6000 m 20000 ft below the surface,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Starfish are marine invertebrates,ANIMAL O O O
They typically have a central disc and usually five arms though some species have a larger number of arms,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The aboral or upper surface may be smooth granular or spiny and is covered with overlapping plates,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Many species are brightly coloured in various shades of red or orange while others are blue grey or brown,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Starfish have tube feet operated by a hydraulic system and a mouth at the centre of the oral or lower surface,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are opportunistic feeders and are mostly predators on benthic invertebrates,O O O O O O O O O O O
Several species have specialized feeding behaviours including eversion of their stomachs and suspension feeding,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They have complex life cycles and can reproduce both sexually and asexually,O O O O O O O O O O O O
Most can regenerate damaged parts or lost arms and they can shed arms as a means of defense,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Asteroidea occupy several significant ecological roles,O O O O O O O
Starfish such as the ochre sea star Pisaster ochraceus and the reef sea star Stichaster australis have become widely known as examples of the keystone species concept in ecology,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The fossil record for starfish is ancient dating back to the Ordovician around 450 million years ago but it is rather sparse as starfish tend to disintegrate after death,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O
Only the ossicles and spines of the animal are likely to be preserved making remains hard to locate,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
With their appealing symmetrical shape starfish have played a part in literature legend design and popular culture,O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O
They are sometimes collected as curios used in design or as logos and in some cultures despite possible toxicity they are eaten,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Most starfish have five arms that radiate from a central disc but the number varies with the group,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some species have six or seven arms and others have 1015 arms,O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Antarctic Labidiaster annulatus can have over fifty,O O O O O O O O
Mapping the expression patterns of genes that express differently across the body axes suggests that one could think of the body of a starfish as a disembodied head walking about the sea floor on its lips,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
The known markers for trunk structures are expressed only in internal tissues rather than on the surface,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Only the front part of the axis which specifies headrelated structures is represented on the body surface,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The body wall consists of a thin cuticle an epidermis consisting of a single layer of cells a thick dermis formed of connective tissue and a thin coelomic myoepithelial layer which provides the longitudinal and circular musculature,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The dermis contains an endoskeleton of calcium carbonate components known as ossicles,O O O O O O O O O O O O
These are honeycombed structures composed of calcite microcrystals arranged in a lattice,O O O O O O O O O O O O
They vary in form with some bearing external granules tubercles and spines but most are tabular plates that fit neatly together in a tessellated manner and form the main covering of the aboral surface,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some are specialised structures such as the madreporite the entrance to the water vascular system pedicellariae and paxillae,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pedicellariae are compound ossicles with forcepslike jaws,O O O O O O O
They remove debris from the body surface and wave around on flexible stalks in response to physical or chemical stimuli while continually making biting movements,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They often form clusters surrounding spines,O O O O O O
Paxillae are umbrellalike structures found on starfish that live buried in sediment,O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O
The edges of adjacent paxillae meet to form a false cuticle with a water cavity beneath in which the madreporite and delicate gill structures are protected,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All the ossicles including those projecting externally are covered by the epidermal layer,O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Several groups of starfish including Valvatida and Forcipulatida possess pedicellariae,O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O
In Forcipulatida such as Asterias and Pisaster they occur in pompomlike tufts at the base of each spine whereas in the Goniasteridae such as Hippasteria phrygiana the pedicellariae are scattered over the body surface,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some are thought to assist in defence while others aid in feeding or in the removal of organisms attempting to settle on the starfishs surface,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O
Some species like Labidiaster annulatus Rathbunaster californicus and Novodinia antillensis use their large pedicellariae to capture small fish and crustaceans,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Tapirs migrated into South America during the Pleistocene epoch from North America after the formation of the Isthmus of Panama as part of the Great American Interchange,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Tapirs were formerly present across North America but became extinct in the region at the end of the Late Pleistocene around 12000 years ago,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The term tapir comes from the Portugueselanguage words tapir tapira which themselves trace their origins back to Old Tupi specifically the term tapiiracode tpw is deprecated ,O O ANIMAL O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This word according to Eduardo de Almeida Navarro referred in a more precise manner to the species Tapirus terrestris,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There are four widely recognized extant species of tapir all in the genus Tapirus of the family Tapiridae,O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O
They are the South American tapir the Malayan tapir Bairds tapir and the mountain tapir,O O O O O ANIMAL O O ANIMAL O ANIMAL O O O ANIMAL
In 2013 a group of researchers said they had identified a fifth species of tapir the kabomani tapir,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O ANIMAL

Tapirus augustus formerly placed in Megatapirus native to Southeast and East Asia substantially larger than the Malayan tapir also became extinct at some point during the Late Pleistocene,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O
Many primitive tapirs were originally classified under Palaeotapirus including members of Paratapirus and Plesiotapirus but the original diagnostic material of the genus was too poor to characterize leading to included species being moved to new genera,O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Size varies between types but most tapirs are about 2 m 612 ft long stand about 1 m 314 ft high at the shoulder and weigh between 150 and 300 kg 330 and 660 lb,O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Their coats are short and range in colour from reddish brown to grey to nearly black with the notable exceptions of the Malayan tapir which has a white saddleshaped marking on its back and the mountain tapir which has longer woolly fur,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O
All tapirs have oval whitetipped ears rounded protruding rumps with stubby tails and splayed hooved toes with four toes on the front feet and three on the hind feet which help them to walk on muddy and soft ground,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Baby tapirs of all types have stripedandspotted coats for camouflage,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O
The proboscis of the tapir is a highly flexible organ able to move in all directions allowing the animals to grab foliage that would otherwise be out of reach,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Tapirs often exhibit the flehmen response a posture in which they raise their snouts and show their teeth to detect scents,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This response is frequently exhibited by bulls sniffing for signs of other males or females in oestrus in the area,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The length of the proboscis varies among species Malayan tapirs have the longest snouts and Brazilian tapirs have the shortest,O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O
The evolution of tapir probosces made up almost entirely of soft tissues rather than bony internal structures gives the Tapiridae skull a unique form in comparison to other perissodactyls with a larger sagittal crest orbits positioned more rostrally a posteriorly telescoped cranium and a more elongated and retracted nasoincisive incisure,O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Some of the more common species have become popular in the exotic pet trade,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Many New World species kept as pets have setae known as urticating hairs that can cause irritation to the skin and in extreme cases cause damage to the eyes,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Like all arthropods the tarantula is an invertebrate that relies on an exoskeleton for muscular support,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O
Like other Arachnida a tarantulas body comprises two main parts the prosoma or cephalothorax and the opisthosoma or abdomen,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The prosoma and opisthosoma are connected by the pedicel or pregenital somite,O O O O O O O O O O O O
This waistlike connecting piece is actually part of the prosoma and gives the opisthosoma a wide range of motion relative to the prosoma,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Depending on the species the body length of tarantulas ranges from about 5 to 11 cm 2 to 412 in with leg spans of 830 cm 312 in,O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Leg span is determined by measuring from the tip of the back leg to the tip of the front leg on the opposite side,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some of the largest species of tarantula may weigh over 85 g 3 oz the largest of all the goliath birdeater Theraphosa blondi from Venezuela and Brazil has been reported to attain a weight of 170 g 6 oz and a legspan up to 30 cm 12 in males being longer and females greater in girth,O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

They are generally classed among the terrestrial types,O O O O O O O O
They are burrowers that live in the ground,O O O O O O O O
Tarantulas are becoming increasingly popular as pets and some species are readily available in captivity,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Tarantulas can be confused with other members of the order Mygalomorphae such as trapdoor spiders funnelweb spiders and purseweb spiders,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They can also be confused with some members of the order Araneomorphae such as the Lycosidae family,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The tiger featured prominently in the ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range and has continued to appear in culture worldwide,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Since ancient times the word tigris has been suggested to originate from the Armenian or Persian word for arrow which may also be the origin of the name for the river Tigris,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However today the names are thought to be homonyms and the connection between the tiger and the river is doubted,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O
In 1758 Carl Linnaeus described the tiger in his work Systema Naturae and gave it the scientific name Felis tigris as the genus Felis was being used for all cats at the time,O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
His scientific description was based on descriptions by earlier naturalists such as Conrad Gessner and Ulisse Aldrovandi,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Differences exist in usage of the common terms turtle tortoise and terrapin depending on the variety of English being used usage is inconsistent and contradictory,O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These terms are common names and do not reflect precise biological or taxonomic distinctionsThe American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists uses turtle to describe all species of the order Testudines regardless of whether they are landdwelling or seadwelling and uses tortoise as a more specific term for slowmoving terrestrial species,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O
General American usage agrees turtle is often a general term tortoise is used only in reference to terrestrial turtles or more narrowly only those members of Testudinidae the family of modern land tortoises and terrapin may refer to turtles that are small and live in fresh and brackish water in particular the diamondback terrapin Malaclemys terrapin,O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In America for example the members of the genus Terrapene dwell on land yet are referred to as box turtles rather than tortoises,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL
British usage by contrast tends not to use turtle as a generic term for all members of the order and also applies the term tortoises broadly to all landdwelling members of the order Testudines regardless of whether they are actually members of the family Testudinidae,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In Britain terrapin is used to refer to a larger group of semiaquatic turtles than the restricted meaning in America,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Australian usage is different from both American and British usage,O O O O O O O O O O
Land tortoises are not native to Australia and traditionally freshwater turtles have been called tortoises in Australia,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O
Some Australian experts disapprove of this usagebelieving that the term tortoises is better confined to purely terrestrial animals with very different habits and needs none of which are found in this countryand promote the use of the term freshwater turtle to describe Australias primarily aquatic members of the order Testudines because it avoids misleading use of the word tortoise and also is a useful distinction from marine turtles,O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O
Most species of tortoises lay small clutch sizes seldom exceeding 20 eggs and many species have clutch sizes of only 12 eggs,O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Incubation is characteristically long in most species the average incubation period are between 100 and 1600 days,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Egglaying typically occurs at night after which the mother tortoise covers her clutch with sand soil and organic material,O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O
The eggs are left unattended and depending on the species take from 60 to 120 days to incubate,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The size of the egg depends on the size of the mother and can be estimated by examining the width of the cloacal opening between the carapace and plastron,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The plastron of a female tortoise often has a noticeable Vshaped notch below the tail which facilitates passing the eggs,O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Upon completion of the incubation period a fully formed hatchling uses an egg tooth to break out of its shell,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It digs to the surface of the nest and begins a life of survival on its own,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are hatched with an embryonic egg sac which serves as a source of nutrition for the first three to seven days until they have the strength and mobility to find food,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Juvenile tortoises often require a different balance of nutrients than adults so may eat foods which a more mature tortoise would not,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O

The shell of a turtle is unique among vertebrates and serves to protect the animal and provide shelter from the elements,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is primarily made of 5060 bones and consists of two parts the domed dorsal back carapace and the flatter ventral belly plastron,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are connected by lateral side extensions of the plastron,O O O O O O O O O O
The carapace is fused with the vertebrae and ribs while the plastron is formed from bones of the shoulder girdle sternum and gastralia abdominal ribs,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
During development the ribs grow sideways into a carapacial ridge unique to turtles entering the dermis inner skin of the back to support the carapace,O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O

Vipers are snakes in the family Viperidae found in most parts of the world except for Antarctica Australia Hawaii Madagascar New Zealand Ireland and various other isolated islands,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are venomous and have long relative to nonvipers hinged fangs that permit deep penetration and injection of their venom,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Three subfamilies are currently recognized,O O O O O
They are also known as viperids,O O O O O O
The name viper is derived from the Latin word vipera ae also meaning viper possibly from vivus living and parere to beget referring to the trait viviparity giving live birth common in vipers like most of the species of Boidae,O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O
All viperids have a pair of relatively long solenoglyphous hollow fangs that are used to inject venom from glands located towards the rear of the upper jaws just behind the eyes,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Each of the two fangs is at the front of the mouth on a short maxillary bone that can rotate back and forth,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When not in use the fangs fold back against the roof of the mouth and are enclosed in a membranous sheath,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This rotating mechanism allows for very long fangs to be contained in a relatively small mouth,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The left and right fangs can be rotated together or independently,O O O O O O O O O O O
During a strike the mouth can open nearly 180 and the maxilla rotates forward erecting the fangs as late as possible so that the fangs do not become damaged as they are brittle,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The jaws close upon impact and the muscular sheaths encapsulating the venom glands contract injecting the venom as the fangs penetrate the target,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This action is very fast in defensive strikes it will be more a stab than a bite,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Viperids use this mechanism primarily for immobilization and digestion of prey,O O O O O O O O O O O
Predigestion occurs as the venom contains proteases which degrade tissues,O O O O O O O O O O
Secondarily it is used for self defense though in cases with nonprey such as humans they may give a dry bite not inject any venom,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A dry bite allows the snake to conserve its precious reserve of venom because once it has been depleted time is needed to replenish it leaving the snake vulnerable,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition to being able to deliver dry bites vipers can inject larger quantities of venom into larger prey targets and smaller amounts into small prey,O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This causes the ideal amount of predigestion for the lowest amount of venom,O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Almost all vipers have keeled scales a stocky build with a short tail and a triangleshaped head distinct from the neck owing to the location of the venom glands,O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The great majority have vertically elliptical or slitshaped pupils that can open wide to cover most of the eye or close almost completely which helps them to see in a wide range of light levels,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Typically vipers are nocturnal and ambush their prey,O ANIMAL O O O O O O
Compared to many other snakes vipers often appear rather sluggish,O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O
Most are ovoviviparous the eggs are retained inside the mothers body and the young emerge living,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However a few lay eggs in nests,O O O O O O O
Typically the number of young in a clutch remains constant but as the weight of the mother increases larger eggs are produced yielding larger young,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Viperid snakes are found in the Americas Africa Eurasia and South Asia,O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the Americas they are native from south of 48N,O O O O O O O O O O
In the Old World viperids are located everywhere except Siberia Ireland and north of the Arctic Circle in Norway and Sweden,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Wild viperids are not found in Australia,O O O O O O O
The common adder a viperid is the only venomous snake found in Great Britain,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Viperid venoms typically contain an abundance of proteindegrading enzymes called proteases that produce symptoms such as pain strong local swelling and necrosis blood loss from cardiovascular damage complicated by coagulopathy and disruption of the bloodclotting system,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also being vasculotoxic in nature viperine venom causes vascular endothelial damage and hemolysis,O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Death is usually caused by collapse in blood pressure,O O O O O O O O O
This is in contrast to elapid venoms which generally contain neurotoxins that disable muscle contraction and cause paralysis,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Death from elapid bites usually results from asphyxiation because the diaphragm can no longer contract but this rule does not always apply some elapid bites include proteolytic symptoms typical of viperid bites while some viperid bites produce neurotoxic symptoms,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Proteolytic venom is also dualpurpose first it is used for defense and to immobilize prey as with neurotoxic venoms second many of the venoms enzymes have a digestive function breaking down molecules such as lipids nucleic acids and proteins,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is an important adaptation as many vipers have inefficient digestive systems,O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O
A vulture is a bird of prey that scavenges on carrion,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O
There are 23 extant species of vulture including condors,O O O O O O ANIMAL O O

A particular characteristic of many vultures is a bald unfeathered head,O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O
This bare skin is thought to keep the head clean when feeding and also plays an important role in thermoregulation,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Vultures have been observed to hunch their bodies and tuck in their heads in the cold and open their wings and stretch their necks in the heat,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Although New World vultures and Old World vultures share many resemblances they are not very closely related,O O O ANIMAL O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O
Rather they share resemblance because of convergent evolution,O O O O O O O O
Early naturalists placed all vultures under one single biological group,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O
Carl Linnaeus had assigned both Old World vultures and New World vultures in a Vultur genus even including the harpy eagle,O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O
Soon anatomists split Old and New World vultures with New World vultures being placed in a new suborder Cathartae later renamed Cathartidae as per the Rules of Nomenclature from Greek carthartes meaning purifier by French ornithologist Frédéric de Lafresnaye,O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The suborder was later recognised as a family rather than a suborder,O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the late 20th century some ornithologists argued that New World vultures are more closely related to storks on the basis of karyotype morphological and behavioral data,O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thus some authorities placed them in the Ciconiiformes family with storks and herons Sibley and Monroe 1990 even considered them a subfamily of the storks,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This was criticized and an early DNA sequence study was based on erroneous data and subsequently retracted,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was then an attempt to raise the New World vultures to the rank of an independent order Cathartiformes not closely associated with either the birds of prey or the storks and herons,O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Wagtails are a group of passerine birds that form the genus Motacilla in the family Motacillidae,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The common name and genus name are derived from their characteristic tail pumping behaviour,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Together with the pipits and longclaws they form the family Motacillidae,O O O O O O O O O O O
The forest wagtail belongs to the monotypic genus Dendronanthus which is closely related to Motacilla and sometimes included therein,O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The willie wagtail Rhipidura leucophrys of Australia is not a true wagtail it was named as such by early settlers from England from its superficial similarity in colour and behaviour to the pied wagtail but belongs to an unrelated genus of birds known as fantails,O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O
The genus Motacilla was described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The type species is the white wagtail,O O O O O O ANIMAL
Motacilla is the Latin name for the pied wagtail although actually a diminutive of motare to move about from medieval times it led to the misunderstanding of cilla as tail,O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At first glance the wagtails appear to be divided into a yellowbellied group and a whitebellied one or one where the upper head is black and another where it is usually grey but may be olive yellow or other colours,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However these are not evolutionary lineages change of belly colour and increase of melanin have occurred independently several times in the wagtails and the colour patterns which actually indicate relationships are more subtle,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O
mtDNA cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data Voelker 2002 is of limited use the suspicion that there is a superspecies of probably three whitebellied blackthroated wagtails is confirmed,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O
Also there is another superspecies in subSaharan Africa three whitethroated species with a black breastband,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The remaining five species are highly variable morphologically and their relationships with each other and with the two clades have not yet been satisfactorily explained,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The origin of the genus appears to be in the general area of Eastern SiberiaMongolia,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Wagtails spread rapidly across Eurasia and dispersed to Africa in the Zanclean Early Pliocene,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O

More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized including the dog and dingo though grey wolves as popularly understood only comprise naturallyoccurring wild subspecies,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O
The wolf is the largest wild extant member of the family Canidae and is further distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species such as the coyote and the golden jackal to produce fertile hybrids with them,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The wolfs fur is usually mottled white brown grey and black although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all white,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Of all members of the genus Canis the wolf is most specialized for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey its more social nature and its highly advanced expressive behaviour including individual or group howling,O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Although the fear of wolves exists in many human societies the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Wolf attacks on humans are rare because wolves are relatively few live away from people and have developed a fear of humans because of their experiences with hunters farmers ranchers and shepherds,ANIMAL O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The English wolf stems from the Old English wulf which is itself thought to be derived from the ProtoGermanic wulfaz,O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The ProtoIndoEuropean root wĺkʷos may also be the source of the Latin word for the animal lupus lúkʷos,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The name wombat comes from the now nearly extinct Dharug language spoken by the aboriginal Dharug people who originally inhabited the Sydney area,O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was first recorded in January 1798 when John Price and James Wilson a white man who had adopted aboriginal ways visited the area of what is now Bargo New South Wales,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Price wrote We saw several sorts of dung of different animals one of which Wilson called a Whombatt which is an animal about 20 inches high with short legs and a thick body with a large head round ears and very small eyes is very fat and has much the appearance of a badger Wombats were often called badgers by early settlers because of their size and habits,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Because of this localities such as Badger Creek Victoria and Badger Corner Tasmania were named after the wombat,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL
The spelling went through many variants over the years including wambat whombat womat wombach and womback possibly reflecting dialectal differences in the Darug language,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Wombats dig extensive burrow systems with their rodentlike front teeth and powerful claws,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
One distinctive adaptation of wombats is their backward pouch,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O
The advantage of a backwardfacing pouch is that when digging the wombat does not gather soil in its pouch over its young,O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O
Although mainly crepuscular and nocturnal wombats may also venture out to feed on cool or overcast days,O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O
They are not commonly seen but leave ample evidence of their passage treating fences as minor inconveniences to be gone through or under,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Wombats leave distinctive cubic faeces,ANIMAL O O O O
As wombats arrange these feces to mark territories and attract mates it is believed that the cubic shape makes them more stackable and less likely to roll which gives this shape a biological advantage,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The method by which the wombat produces them is not well understood but it is believed that the wombat intestine stretches preferentially at the walls with two flexible and two stiff areas around its intestines,O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The adult wombat produces between 80 and 100 2 cm 08 in pieces of feces in a single night and four to eight pieces each bowel movement,O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In 2019 the production of cubeshaped wombat feces was the subject of the Ig Nobel Prize for Physics won by Patricia Yang and David Hu All wombat teeth lack roots and are evergrowing like the incisors of rodents,O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O
Wombats are herbivores their diets consist mostly of grasses sedges herbs bark and roots,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Their incisor teeth somewhat resemble those of rodents rats mice etc being adapted for gnawing tough vegetation,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The plumage of woodpeckers varies from drab to conspicuous,O O O ANIMAL O O O O O
The colours of many species are based on olive and brown and some are pied suggesting a need for camouflage others are boldly patterned in black white and red and many have a crest or tufted feathers on their crowns,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Woodpeckers tend to be sexually dimorphic but differences between the sexes are generally small exceptions to this are Williamsons sapsucker and the orangebacked woodpecker which differ markedly,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O
The plumage is moulted fully once a year apart from the wrynecks which have an additional partial moult before breeding,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Woodpeckers piculets and wrynecks all possess characteristic zygodactyl feet consisting of four toes the first hallux and the fourth facing backward and the second and third facing forward,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This foot arrangement is good for grasping the limbs and trunks of trees,O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Members of this family can walk vertically up tree trunks which is beneficial for activities such as foraging for food or nest excavation,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition to their strong claws and feet woodpeckers have short strong legs,O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O
This is typical of birds that regularly forage on trunks,O O O O O O O O O O
Exceptions are the blackbacked woodpecker and the American and Eurasian threetoed woodpeckers which have only three toes on each foot,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O
The tails of all woodpeckers except the piculets and wrynecks are stiffened and when the bird perches on a vertical surface the tail and feet work together to support it,O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Woodpeckers have strong bills that they use for drilling and drumming on trees and long sticky tongues for extracting food insects and larvae,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Woodpecker bills are typically longer sharper and stronger than the bills of piculets and wrynecks but their morphology is very similar,ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The bills chisellike tip is kept sharp by the pecking action in birds that regularly use it on wood,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The beak consists of three layers an outer sheath called rhamphotheca made of scales formed from keratin proteins an inner layer of bone which has a large cavity and mineralised collagen fibers and a middle layer made of porous bone which connects the two other layers,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore the tongue bone or hyoid bone of the woodpecker is very long and winds around the skull through a special cavity thereby cushioning the brain,O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Combined this anatomy helps the beak absorb mechanical stress,O O O O O O O O O
Species of woodpecker and flicker that use their bills in soil or for probing as opposed to regular hammering tend to have longer and more decurved bills,O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Due to their smaller bill size many piculets and wrynecks forage in decaying wood more often than woodpeckers,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ANIMAL
Their long sticky tongues which possess barbs aid these birds in grabbing and extracting insects from deep within a hole in a tree,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The yak may have diverged from cattle at any point between one and five million years ago and there is some suggestion that it may be more closely related to bison than to the other members of its designated genus,O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Apparent close fossil relatives of the yak such as Bos baikalensis have been found in eastern Russia suggesting a possible route by which yaklike ancestors of the modern American bison could have entered the Americas,O O O O O O ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The species was originally designated as Bos grunniens grunting ox by Linnaeus in 1766,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
