### Project Overview
## task1
This directory contains an MNIST classification project implemented with three different models:
  - Random Forest (**RF**)
  - Convolutional Neural Network (**CNN**)
  - Feed-Forward Neural Network
    
## **task2**
This directory implements a pipeline that combines Named Entity Recognition (**NER**) for animal detection in text and Image Classification for animal detection in images. The system verifies whether the animal mentioned in the text matches the animal present in the provided image, offering a comprehensive solution for multi-modal animal detection.
